<span class="title-prefix">2.7</span> The Conclusion for Our Students</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stengel_1.0-ch02_s07_p01">Our students will look at this analysis and decide not only to go forward with the ice cream business on the beach but to charge $1.80, since that is the price on the demand curve corresponding to a sales volume of 30,000 ice cream bars. Their expected revenue will be $54,000, which coincidently is the same as in the original plan, but the economic costs will be only $49,000, which is lower than in the original analysis, and their economic profit will be slightly higher, at $5000.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stengel_1.0-ch02_s07_p02">At first glance, a $5000 profit does not seem like much. However, bear in mind that we already assigned an opportunity cost to the studentsâ€™ time based on the income foregone by not accepting the corporate internships. So the students can expect to complete the summer with $10,000 each to compensate for the lost internship income and still have an additional $5000 to split between them.</p>
