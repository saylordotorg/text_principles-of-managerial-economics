<span class="title-prefix">2.3</span> Revenue, Cost, and Profit Functions</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stengel_1.0-ch02_s03_p01">In the preceding projections for the proposed ice cream bar venture, the assumption was that 36,000 ice cream bars would be sold based on the volume in the prior summer. However, the actual volume for a future venture might be higher or lower. And with an economic profit so close to zero, our students should consider the impact of any such differences.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stengel_1.0-ch02_s03_p02">There is a relationship between the volume or quantity created and sold and the resulting impact on revenue, cost, and profit. These relationships are called the revenue function, cost function, and profit function. These relationships can be expressed in terms of tables, graphs, or algebraic equations.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stengel_1.0-ch02_s03_p03">In a case where a business sells one kind of product or service, revenue is the product of the price per unit times the number of units sold. If we assume ice cream bars will be sold for $1.50 apiece, the equation for the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">revenue function</a><span class="glossdef">The product of the price per unit times the number of units sold; R = P*Q.</span></span> will be</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">R = $1.5 Q,</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stengel_1.0-ch02_s03_p04">where R is the revenue and Q is the number of units sold.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stengel_1.0-ch02_s03_p05">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cost function</a><span class="glossdef">The sum of fixed cost and the product of the variable cost per unit times quantity of units produced, also called total cost; C = F + V*Q.</span></span> for the ice cream bar venture has two components: the fixed cost component of $40,000 that remains the same regardless of the volume of units and the variable cost component of $0.30 times the number of items. The equation for the cost function is</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">C = $40,000 + $0.3 Q,</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stengel_1.0-ch02_s03_p06">where C is the total cost. Note we are measuring economic cost, not accounting cost.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stengel_1.0-ch02_s03_p07">Since profit is the difference between revenue and cost, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">profit functions</a><span class="glossdef">The revenue function minus the cost function; in symbols π = R - C = (P*Q) - (F + V*Q).</span></span> will be</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">π = R − C = $1.2 Q − $40,000.</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stengel_1.0-ch02_s03_p08">Here π is used as the symbol for profit. (The letter P is reserved for use later as a symbol for price.)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stengel_1.0-ch02_s03_p09"><a class="xref" href="#stengel_1.0-ch02_s03_t01">Table 2.1 "Revenue, Cost, and Profit for Selected Sales Volumes for Ice Cream Bar Venture"</a> provides actual values for revenue, cost, and profit for selected values of the volume quantity Q. <a class="xref" href="#stengel_1.0-ch02_s03_f01">Figure 2.1 "Graphs of Revenue, Cost, and Profit Functions for Ice Cream Bar Business at Price of $1.50"</a>, provides graphs of the revenue, cost, and profit functions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stengel_1.0-ch02_s03_p10">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">average cost</a><span class="glossdef">The total cost divided by the quantity produced; AC = C/Q.</span></span> is another interesting measure to track. This is calculated by dividing the total cost by the quantity. The relationship between average cost and quantity is the <em class="emphasis">average cost function</em>. For the ice cream bar venture, the equation for this function would be</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">AC = C/Q = ($40,000 + $0.3 Q)/Q = $0.3 + $40,000/Q.</span></span>

Note that the average cost function starts out very high but drops quickly and levels off.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="stengel_1.0-ch02_s03_p12">Essentially the average cost function is the variable cost per unit of $0.30 plus a portion of the fixed cost allocated across all units. For low volumes, there are few units to spread the fixed cost, so the average cost is very high. However, as the volume gets large, the fixed cost impact on average cost becomes small and is dominated by the variable cost component.</p>
