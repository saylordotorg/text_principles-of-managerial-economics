    <p class="para editable block" id="stengel_1.0-ch01_s04_p01">Like any academic subject, economics can seem like an abstract pursuit that is of greatest interest to economists who want to communicate with other economists. However, while there is certainly a substantial body of written research that may reinforce that impression, this book is written with the belief that economics provides a language and a perspective that is useful for general managers.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="stengel_1.0-ch01_s04_p02">All readers have a considerable experience base with the phenomena that economics tries to address, as managers, consumers, or citizens interested in what is happening in their world and why. As you read the book, I encourage you to try to apply the concepts and theories to economic phenomena you have experienced. By doing so, the content of the book will make more sense and you are more likely to apply what you will read here in your future activities as a player in the world of business and economics.</p>
